for example a card payment, a PayPal payment, or a Bitcoin payment.

* Determine the available payment methods in a cluster
* Determine the available payment method for a buyer in a specific currency and country
* Register (also known as tokenize) a payment method for a buyer
* Fetch all previously tokenized payment methods for a buyer
