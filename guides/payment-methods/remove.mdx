title: Remove a payment method

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

A previously vaulted payment method van be removed from Gr4vy by calling the
[`DELETE /payment-methods/:id`][api] API.

:::info

This API does not actually remove the stored payment method from any of the
underlying payment services. It simply removes the record in Gr4vy.

:::

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="curl"
  values={[
    { label: 'cURL', value: 'curl', },
    { label: 'Node', value: 'node', },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl -i -X DELETE "https://api.{merchant}.gr4vy.app/payment-methods/77a76f7e-d2de-4bbc-ada9-d6a0015e6bd5" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node">

```js {10-13}
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

fetch(
  "https://api.{merchant}.gr4vy.app/payment-methods/77a76f7e-d2de-4bbc-ada9-d6a0015e6bd5",
  {
    method: "DELETE",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]",
    },
  }
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The API returns an empty response once the payment method was removed.
