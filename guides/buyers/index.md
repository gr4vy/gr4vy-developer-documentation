In Gr4vy, a buyer represents a merchant's customer, the shopper who's performing
a checkout and making a purchase.

## Features

A buyer can be used by a merchant to:

* Display a human readable name (`display_name`) for a buyer in the Gr4vy admin panel
* Associate multiple tokenized payment methods with a single user
* Initialize **Gr4vy Embed** with the buyer ID, automatically displaying the
  buyer's previously stored payment methods, allowing for faster checkout.
