Before your application can communicate with the Gr4vy API we will need to
create a new API key. The Gr4vy API handles authentication using a signed JWT
which is passed as a `bearer` token in a HTTP header.

```http
GET https://api.{merchant}.gr4vy.app/transactions
authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIi...
```

Our SDKs make doing this in your preferred programming language a lot easier,
which we will get to in the next step.

## Generate a new private key

To use the API you will need to generate a new **private API key**, head over to
your Gr4vy Admin panel and visit the integrations page.

On this page, click the "Generate" button and you will be shown a new private
key and a key ID. You will need to store these securely as we will not show
these to you again.

:::info What is a private key?

The private key you just created is part of a pair of keys, a key-pair! The
private key is held and only known to you. The public key is held by us and used
to validate that any API requests were made by the holder of the private key.
