title: API Authentication
---

Authentication to the Gr4vy API is done through JSON Web Tokens passed to the
API via the `authorization`-header as a bearer-token.

## `authorization`-header

At the core of all Gr4vy API authentication is the `authorization` header. The
API requires this header to be sent for every API call that requires
authentication. The value for this token needs to be in the format
`bearer [token]`.

```bash {2}
curl -i -X GET "https://api.{subdomain}.gr4vy.app/transactions" \
    -H "authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
```

The actual value of the `[token]` is a signed JWT. There are 2 ways to obtain a
JWT token.

## JSON Web Tokens

The Gr4vy API has support for 2 different kind of JWT tokens.

- **User session tokens:** a user session token is created server-side by the
  Gr4vy cluster by passing an email address and a password to the
  [`POST /sessions`](/reference/internal#operation/login) API. These tokens
  represent a Gr4vy Admin user and allow access to most APIs though some role
  permissions might be applied in the future.
- **API tokens:** an API token is created server-side by the merchant using a
  private key that was created by calling the
  [`POST /api-key-pairs`](/reference/internal#operation/create-api-key-pair)
  API. An API token represents the merchant and is used by the merchant to
  create tokens used by Gr4vy Embed or for direct server-to-server
  authentication. API tokens are not tied to a specific Gr4vy Admin user and
  therefore do not allow access to the user-APIs.

### Session tokens

Session tokens are created by the Gr4vy Admin frontend by calling the
[`POST /auth/sessions`](/reference/internal#operation/login) API with a username
and password.

```bash
curl -i -X POST "https://api.{subdomain}.gr4vy.app/auth/sessions" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "email_address": "john@example.com",
      "password": "this-is-n0t-a-secure-passw0rd"
    }'
```

The response includes both an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`. Each of
these are an signed JWT.

```json
{
  "type": "auth.session",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI...",
  "expires_in": 600
}
```

The refresh token is used once the access token has expired by calling the
[`PUT /auth/sessions`](/reference/internal#operation/refresh-session) with the
`refresh_token` as the bearer token.

```bash
curl -i -X PUT "https://api.{subdomain}.gr4vy.app/auth/sessions" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [REFRESH_TOKEN]"
```

The response includes a new session with a new `access_token` and
`refresh_token`.

#### `access_token`

The access token follows the following format.

```json title="Header"
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256" // only current supported algorithm
}
```

```json title="Claims"
{
  // the unique ID of the private key used to create this claim
  "iss": "gg9ILy",
  // a random session ID that ties the claim to a session
  // and subsequently to a user
  "sub": "ad88f558-7174-42fe-b29c-0442546ab73e",
  // unix time the token was issued at. the token should be rejected if this
  // date is set before the current server time
  "nbf": 1607976645,
  // unix time the token was issued at plus a to be
  // determined expiration time (5 minutes?)
  "exp": 1607976314,
  // a unique ID for this JWT, used to add entropy
  "jti": "0fe1fb1b-2f7e-4c8d-b0eb-aae5d0ec98f7",
  // this token defaults to a cluster_admin scope
  "scope": ["auth"]
}
```

Refreshed access tokens will have the same content as an old access token but
with a new `jti`, `nbf` and `exp` value.

#### `refresh_token`

A refresh token is a more narrowly scoped token that only allows for refreshing
the access token. It follows the following format.

```json title="Header"
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256"
}
```

```json title="Claims"
{
  // all of these values are the same as an access token
  "iss": "gg9ILy",
  "sub": "ad88f558-7174-42fe-b29c-0442546ab73e",
  "nbf": 1607976645,
  "jti": "0fe1fb1b-2f7e-4c8d-b0eb-aae5d0ec98f7",
  // the expiration for this token is considerably longer
  // (current time + 1 hour?)
  "exp": 1611577128,
  // the scope for this token is explicitly set to only allow for
  // token refresh
  "scope": ["sessions.write"]
}
```

Refreshed refresh tokens will have the same content as an old access token but
with a new `jti`, `nbf` and `exp` value.

### API tokens

API tokens are server-side by a merchant using the private key from an API
key-pair.

#### Generate an API key-pair

An API key pair can be created via the Gr4vy admin. The admin UI uses the
[`POST /api-key-pairs`](/reference/internal#operation/create-api-key-pair) API
authenticated with a session token.

```bash
curl -i -X POST "https://api.{subdomain}.gr4vy.app/api-key-pairs" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [SESSION_TOKEN]"
```

The response is a new key-pair including a private key and a passphrase. This
key needs to be saved by the merchant directly as it will not be saved by Gr4vy
and can not be re-requested.

```json
{
  "type": "api-key-pair",
  "id": "gg9ILy",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "passphrase": "af2675c9aba7de1f3bccb30757d7afd8",
  "created_at": "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00",
  "updated_at": "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
}
```

#### Create API token

To create an API token, a merchant creates a JWT with the following header and
claims.

```json title="Header"
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256"
}
```

```json title="Claims"
{
  // the unique ID of the private key used to create this claim.
  "iss": "gg9ILy",
  // as this is a server-to-server call it does not represent a user
  // and therefore the subject can be null or missing
  "sub": null,
  // unix time the token was issued at. the token should be rejected if this
  // date is set before the current server time
  "nbf": 1607976645,
  // The unix time the token was issued at plus an expiration time that can be
  // defined by the merchant. This can realistically be either a very large
  // time or the merchant could use a very small expiration time and generate a
  // new token for every request.
  "exp": 1607976314,
  // a unique ID for this JWT, used to add entropy
  "jti": "0fe1fb1b-2f7e-4c8d-b0eb-aae5d0ec98f7",
  // Defining scopes is optional and it restricts the API to only some API
  // calls. This is used when passing an API token to Gr4vy Embed to prevent the
  // API token from being used to access APIs it should not have access to.
  "scope": ["embed"],
  // A list of key-value pairs of data that might be submitted as request
  // parameters either in the query or in the body. Setting these values here
  // pins them to these values in the request, preventing them from being
  // changed server-side. This is used when passing an API token to Gr4vy Embed
  // to prevent the API token from being used to perform a different API call
  // than intended. For example, setting the `buyer_id`, `amount` and `currency`
  // restricts the API to only fetch payment options for the given buyer, and
  // only create a transaction of 200 USD exactly.
  "data": {
    "POST /transactions": {
      "amount": "200",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "GET /buyers/:buyer_id/payment-methods": {
      "buyer_id": "d757c76a-cbd7-4b56-95a3-40125b51b29c"
    }
  }
}
```

| Scope               | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{resources}.read`  | Allows read-access to a type or resource. For example, `buyers.read` enabled read-access for buyers data.                                                         |

| `sessions.write`    | Used by the refresh token, allowing it to be used to refresh the access token.                                                                                    |

| `auth`              | A scope that represents all the access needed by Gr4vy the cluster admin interface. This scope should only work for session-tokens generated by Gr4vy for a user. |
