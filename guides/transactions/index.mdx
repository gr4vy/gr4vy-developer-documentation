In Gr4vy, a transaction represents a payment in any state, either before it is
authorized, once it is captured, or after it has been refunded.

## Features

The transactions API can be used to:

- Authorize, capture, and store cards
- Authorize, capture, and store alternative payment methods like PayPal
- Refund, void, and otherwise cancel existing transactions

:::note Use Gr4vy Embed

There is no need to use these APIs directly if you are using [Gr4vy Embed]
instead. [Gr4vy Embed] automatically creates transactions against these APIs and
binds them to a `buyer_id` of your configuration.
